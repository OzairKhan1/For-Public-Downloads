1. Open the port in EC2 Security Group
   - Inbound Rule: TCP, Port = 8890 or any other port, Source = Your IP (or 0.0.0.0/0 if testing)

2. Edit SSH server config on EC2
   File: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   Add or update these lines:
     AllowTcpForwarding yes         # this options are commented by default
     GatewayPorts yes				# this options are commented by defau

3. Restart SSH service
   sudo systemctl restart ssh
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload

4. From LAN side (your PC/router side), run the reverse SSH tunnel:
   ssh -i testKey.pem -N -R 0.0.0.0:8890:192.168.1.1:80 ubuntu@54.80.250.133

5. Test from EC2 or anywhere:
   curl http://54.80.250.133:8890


// To Run it from .bat File just put there: 
@echo off
start "" ssh -i testKey.pem -N -R 0.0.0.0:8890:192.168.1.1:80 ubuntu@54.80.250.133
