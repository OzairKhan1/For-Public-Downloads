From Lec # 04 

1: The number of control connections b/w vEdge and vSmart will depends on the number of Transportations
2: vEdge will share Tlocs via omp (overlay management protocol) to vSmart and the vSmart will share the same
tlocs with other vEdge and cEdge, through these tlocs the Ipsec connection will establish
	Tlocs is the combination of these 3
	1: System-ip (This is a unique id for vEdge e.g 1.1.1.1 like router-id in ospf )
	2: color  (it refers to the transportation. it could be biz-internet or mpls )
	3: Encapsulation (Ipsec or Gre) 

3: The number of Ipsec connections depeneds upon the number of tlocs or transportation b/w vEdges and cEdges
4: Irrespective of the number of Tlocs there will be only 1 OMP sessions b/w vEdge and vSmart
	Multiple control connections ≠ multiple OMP sessions
	✔ Only one OMP session per vEdge to vSmart
5: vEdges in the same site will not make an Ipsec connection due to same Site-Id
6: DTLS tunnels are control connections that run between:

	vEdge ↔ vSmart

	vEdge ↔ vManage

	vSmart ↔ vManage

	vSmart ↔ vSmart (if applicable)

	All vEdges initially form a temporary DTLS connection with vBond, which acts as the orchestrator. Once validated, vBond provides the IP addresses of vSmart and vManage to the vEdge.

	Then, vEdges establish permanent control connections with both vSmart (for OMP) and vManage (for monitoring/configuration).

7: ✅ Connection Types Between Controllers:
	Connection	Type	Purpose
	vEdge ↔ vBond	Temporary	Only for initial authentication and orchestration.
	vBond ↔ vSmart	Temporary	Used only to relay information during vEdge onboarding.
	vBond ↔ vManage	Temporary	Same — for coordination during device bring-up.
	vManage ↔ vSmart		Permanent	Control and policy synchronization, configuration distribution.


8: The number of BFD (Bidirection Failure Detection) sessions also depends on the number of Transportation


9: VPN 0 is the foundation of SD-WAN. Without it, your router can't even "join the network." It is part of the underlay network,
	 and it powers the connectivity that your overlay (Service VPNs) runs on. 
10: All Connections to the Transportation will be under Vpn 0. 



--------------------------------------- Tempelete in Sd-Wan----------------------------------
WE have 2 type of templets 
1: Feature Tempelete
2: Device Tempelete

1 => In the Feature Temp, the temp is design for the an individual Feature like
a: interface g0/0, g0/1 , g0/2 depeneds how many interface or in use on device , like vEdge
b: Vpn 0 , Vpn 512 , service vpn like Vpn 10 e.t.c
c: Ospf, Bgp , if in use
d: system Tempelete 
and more depends upon their usage in the configuration

2 => In Device Tempelete all these Feature Temp are combine to make a single "Feature base device Tempelete". 

Once the Device temp is design we can easily attach to any device. 
Make sure while designing the feature temp, the variables are needed to be keep in mind. 
We have 3 options
1: default
2: global
3: Device specific

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Main Configuration That is done on the vEdges  (Vpn 0 and System Configuration) 
1: Configuration of Ip
2: Getting a Verified Certificate and Serial number via CA Server (put this in vBond and vManage to bring the device up)
3: System Configuration on the vEdge (it consists of 6 main configurations) even if the serail number is paste in the above step the device will not be in vManage
	1: host-name
	2: system-ip
	3: site-id
	4: organization-name
	5: vBond ip
	6: clock timezone    (Asia/Kolkata) 
	
Main Configuration that is Done on Vpn 0
1: Vpn 0
2: interface of the router that is connected to transportation either biz-Internet or Mpls
3: ip address, 192.168.1.1/24 (no like config on router with maks of 255.255.255.0) no shut
4: tunnel-interface
5: allow-service all
6: allow-service sshd
7: allow-service netconf
8: ip route (0.0.0.0/0 nexthop ) if necessary 
9: commit. (In SD-Wan this is very Important line to enter. Otherwise no configuration will be updated or saved ) 


-------------------------------------- Main Commands---------------------------
1: show ipsec inbound connection
2: show ipsec outbound connection
3: show omp tlocs
4: show ip route omp
5: show omp peers          (This will give the session b/w vSmart and all other devices )
5: color mpls restict or color biz-internt restrict ( The restrict is very important at the end of the color to avoid ipsec of different color)



10: request software reset (for reseting the device to Factory Configuration)
