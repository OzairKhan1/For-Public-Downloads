 1. Download Embedded Python
Go to: Download Python 3.11.3 Embedded ZIP

Download the latest embedded version (e.g., python-3.11.3-embed-amd64.zip)

Extract it to your project folder:



2: Keep the Embedded Python file inside a folder
this is the tree

YourProject/
└── python-embed/
    ├── python.exe
    ├── python311.zip
    ├── Lib/
    ├── Scripts/  (will be created after pip installation)
    ├── python311._pth

3: Download the File:  get-pip.py using this url : https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py   (Save the file .py)

4: go to the embedded folder using cmd. then run this command : python get-pip.py


5: Fix the _pth file
Open python311._pth (or whatever version you have).

Edit it to look like this: 

python311.zip
.
Lib
Scripts
import site

6: Use the pip command to install all the necessary packages 
python -m pip install streamlit pandas requests beautifulsoup4 openpyxl matplotlib


7: In this step also add the .py (main Code) to your project folder not inside the embedded file

the structure should be like this
YourProject/
├── Friendsy Scrapper.py
└── python-embed/
    ├── python.exe
    ├── Lib/
    ├── Scripts/
    ├── (pip installed packages)



8: Once the project is prepared then create a .bat file to run easily 
the .bat should be as follow

@echo off
title Friendsy Scrapper Launcher
echo Launching App...

REM Set PATH to embedded Python
set PATH=%~dp0python-embed;%PATH%

REM Launch Streamlit app
python -m streamlit run "Friendsy Scrapper.py" --server.headless=false

pause
